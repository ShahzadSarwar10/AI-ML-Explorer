#Simplifying words to their most basic form is called stemming, and it is made easier by stemmers or stemming algorithms. For example,
# “chocolates” becomes “chocolate” and “retrieval” becomes “retrieve.” This is crucial for pipelines for natural language processing,
#  which use tokenized words that are acquired from the first stage of dissecting a document into its constituent words.
#  In contrast to stemming, lemmatization is a lot more powerful. It looks beyond word reduction and considers a language’s full vocabulary 
#  to apply a morphological analysis to words, aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word,
#   which is known as the lemma.

What is POS(Parts-Of-Speech) Tagging?
Parts of Speech tagging is a linguistic activity in Natural Language Processing (NLP) wherein each word in a document is given a particular part of speech (adverb,
 adjective, verb, etc.) or grammatical category. Through the addition of a layer of syntactic and semantic information to the words, this procedure makes it easier 
 to comprehend the sentence’s structure and meaning.

""""What is Chunking?
Chunking involves grouping together individual pieces of information from a sentence, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, into larger units known as chunks.
 The most common type of chunking is noun phrase (NP) chunking, which involves identifying and extracting noun phrases from a sentence, such as "the cat," "a book,"
   or "my friend." Another type of chunking is verb phrase (VP) chunking, which involves identifying and extracting verb phrases from a sentence, such as 
   "ate breakfast," "is running," or "will sing."

What is Chinking?
Chinking, on the other hand, is the process of excluding certain words or phrases from a chunk. This is useful when we want to exclude specific types of words, 
such as prepositions, conjunctions, or determiners, from the chunks we extract. Chinking is typically used in combination with chunking, and it involves identifying 
the words or phrases that we want to exclude from a chunk and marking them with the tag O (outside) in a named entity recognition (NER) system.

See: https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.chunk.RegexpParser.html?highlight=chunkscore


nltk.chunk.RegexpParser
class nltk.chunk.RegexpParser[source]
Bases: ChunkParserI

A grammar based chunk parser. chunk.RegexpParser uses a set of regular expression patterns to specify the behavior of the parser. The chunking of the text is encoded using a ChunkString, and each rule acts by modifying the chunking in the ChunkString. The rules are all implemented using regular expression matching and substitution.

A grammar contains one or more clauses in the following form:

NP:
  {<DT|JJ>}          # chunk determiners and adjectives
  }<[\.VI].*>+{      # strip any tag beginning with V, I, or .
  <.*>}{<DT>         # split a chunk at a determiner
  <DT|JJ>{}<NN.*>    # merge chunk ending with det/adj
                     # with one starting with a noun
The patterns of a clause are executed in order. An earlier pattern may introduce a chunk boundary that prevents a later pattern from executing. Sometimes an individual pattern will match on multiple, overlapping extents of the input. As with regular expression substitution more generally, the chunker will identify the first match possible, then continue looking for matches after this one has ended.

About WordNet
WordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct
 concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be 
 navigated with the browser(Link is external). WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational 
 linguistics and natural language processing.

WordNet superficially resembles a thesaurus, in that it groups words together based on their meanings. However, there are some important distinctions.
 First, WordNet interlinks not just word forms—strings of letters—but specific senses of words. As a result, words that are found in close proximity to one another 
 in the network are semantically disambiguated. Second, WordNet labels the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus does not follow 
 any explicit pattern other than meaning similarity."""

In natural language processing (NLP), feature extraction is a fundamental task that involves converting raw text data into a format that can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms. There are various techniques available for feature extraction in NLP, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. As a data scientist, it’s important to have a good understanding of the different feature extraction techniques available and their appropriate use cases.

In this article, I will explore several common techniques for feature extraction in NLP, including CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, word embeddings, bag of words, bag of n-grams, HashingVectorizer, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and Part-of-Speach (POS) tagging.

Bag of words (BoW) model in NLP
In this article, we are going to discuss a Natural Language Processing technique of text modeling known as Bag of Words model. Whenever we apply any algorithm in NLP, it works on numbers. We cannot directly feed our text into that algorithm. Hence, Bag of Words model is used to preprocess the text by converting it into a bag of words, which keeps a count of the total occurrences of most frequently used words.

This model can be visualized using a table, which contains the count of words corresponding to the word itself.
